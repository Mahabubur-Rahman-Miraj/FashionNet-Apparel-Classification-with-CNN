# FashionNet: Apparel Classification with CNN

## Project Overview
**FashionNet** is a deep learning project focused on classifying apparel images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the model can accurately identify various clothing items, including T-shirts, trousers, coats, and more. The project explores how CNNs can efficiently recognize and categorize fashion-related images.

## Features
- **Apparel Classification**: Identifies 10 different types of clothing.
- **CNN Architecture**: Utilizes a deep learning model optimized for image recognition tasks.
- **Visualization**: Displays predicted vs. actual labels for test images with color-coded results (green for correct, red for incorrect).

## Dataset
The **Fashion MNIST** dataset consists of grayscale images of size 28x28, representing 10 categories of clothing items. It includes:
- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 test images

### Classes
The dataset includes the following clothing categories:
1. T-shirt/top
2. Trouser
3. Pullover
4. Dress
5. Coat
6. Sandal
7. Shirt
8. Sneaker
9. Bag
10. Ankle boot

## Model Architecture
The project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture known for its performance in image classification. The CNN consists of:
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Max-pooling layers for down-sampling
- Fully connected layers for classification

## Installation
### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the framework you're using)
